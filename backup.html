                <p><em>Of course I have a disaster recovery plan. Unfortunately it was on my hard drive when it crashed... (from a business meeting, in a galaxy far far away)</em></p>
<p>Computers fail, hard drives stop working, data gets corrupted. There is a sizeable body of work about datacenters using thousands of commodity hardware or high end server machines, that failure is inevitable.</p>
<p>And while in datacenters replacing failed hard drive is relatively painless, if the hard drive fails in the laptop that you use in your daily business, that may stall you for a week or more while you are waiting for IT folks to repair it. Besides after they repair your laptop, you might get back it all empty with all your spreadsheets and other important documents gone out of the window.</p>
<p>As as business owner you are accustomed to balancing risks. In today's digital world, if you lose all your invoices or project notes, how much time will it take for you to recover?</p>
<p>So if you don't have a backup habit in place, here are few simple beginner tips to get you going without further procrastination.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decide what are the most important documents and put them in one folder. If you are on Windows, they are likely already in My Documents, so you are all good in here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the size of that folder and get a USB stick or external hard drive at least twice that much. So if you have 20 gigabytes of data, get at least 64gb disk. Key chain USB sticks are most convenient, they are always in your pocket and handy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use any free file synchronization tool (for example FreeFileSync) to copy your folder to your drive. Benefit of this kind of tool is that next time you use it it will copy only the changed files taking minimal amount of time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Just put a reminder to do steps 3 every couple of days or so, to keep your essential business data safely of your laptop.</p>
<p>One last thought: at the basic level, you don't need to backup anything more than the documents you are working on. Everything else is relatively easy to restore. Conversely the business files that you or your employees created will take significant efforts to replicate - just remember how much time you spent creating them in the first place.</p>
<p>We will cover cloud and more sophisticated backup approaches in later posts. If you are using Drop Box, Share Point or Google Drive you are already half way there. Still nothing beats having a piece of mind that you have all your essential files in your pocket, for the cases when you have no access to Internet and you are in a rush to send that proposal by the end of the day.</p>
