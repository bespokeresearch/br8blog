<p>Remember that feeling of satisfaction at the end of the day knowing that you took knocked bunch of items off your list. Fells good isn't it? How many of them you carried over the line, because you had a block of uninterrupted time where you could focus, get into the flow and completely destroy it?</p>
<p>We thought they were there to give us a feeling of comfort that we are connected, not to miss on anything. Numerous apps installed on our multiple devices, each demanding our immediate attention with vibration or that little icon with number: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Reddit, WhatsApp... Stream of incoming data is endless. Isn't it strange that we are so patient with all of them, and may almost snap at a live human if they try to ask as something?</p>
<p>All the applications on the phone and the computer have a way to turn off notification. Imagine a perfect, serene world without distractions. The funny thing is - it is completely up to you to make it that way. All you have to do is decide on a comfortable schedule for yourself, say every 1-2 hours, and check your emails/Facebook/text when it is their time. May feel some anxiety at first, but consider this: how many emails or messages are important enough that need immediate attention? Maybe one or two, and the rest can definitely simmer while we finish what we have planned to do for the day.</p>
<p>We use software to make our life more comfortable and makes ourselves more productive. Let's keep it that way, instead of acting as a concierge serving our software overlord's every whim.</p>
